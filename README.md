# DDcGAN in TensorFlow 2

This repository contains an implementation of the Dual-Discriminator Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (DDcGAN) using TensorFlow 2. DDcGAN is a powerful framework for multi-modal image fusion, particularly suited for infrared-visible and MRI-PET image pairs.

## Features
- Implemented in TensorFlow 2
- Supports multi-resolution image fusion
- Includes data preprocessing and augmentation
- Provides evaluation metrics for generated images

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ddcgan-tensorflow2.git
cd ddcgan-tensorflow2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This implementation is based on the original DDcGAN paper [provide citation].
